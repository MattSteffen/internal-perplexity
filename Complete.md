# MVP

## General

- [x] Outline MVP and future prospects
  - [x] Create project structure
  - [x] Decide what actual problems I am solving (what is really hard about this)
  - [x] Core purpose, target audience, value proposition, types of queries this should handle
- [x] Create roadmap

## Frontend

- [x] Decide framework
  - Vue JS
  - **OpenwebUI**
    - If I want to start with something that is big and a lot of features, this'll work
    - This doesn't allow very good customization of the UI.
    - If I don't want to put in the work to make a good UI, this'll work
    - I would simply add my own custom pipeline and have that be used.
