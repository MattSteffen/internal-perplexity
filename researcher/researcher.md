# MVP

Below is a comprehensive documentation package describing the minimal viable product (MVP) for your recursive researcher agent. This documentation outlines the Python modules (files) you should create, their purpose, key responsibilities, and guidelines on what to include in each file. The design combines core ideas from the provided outlines (Claude, ChatGPT, and Deepseek) and is scoped to an MVP that is functional without being overly complex.

- **Maintainability:**

  - Follow clear module boundaries and document each file.
  - Use dependency injection (e.g., pass LLM and vectorstore instances) to ease testing.
  - Apply error handling and logging consistently across modules.

- **Scalability (for Future Enhancements):**
  - Design worker spawning and recursion with a maximum depth.
  - Modularize each component so that you can replace, for example, Milvus with another vectorstore without major changes.

---

## 4. Final Notes

- **Documentation:**  
  Each Python file should include module-level docstrings and inline comments explaining function parameters, return values, and error handling.
- **Version Control & Testing:**  
  Maintain tests in the `tests/` directory and consider using a CI pipeline to run tests on every commit.
- **Configuration Management:**  
  Keep configuration files well documented and consider adding example configurations in the repository.

This documentation provides a clear roadmap for building an MVP of your researcher agent. As you implement each module, refer back to this guide to ensure that components interact as intended, keeping the system both modular and extensible.

## 8. Implementation Roadmap

1. **Setup Configuration:**
   - Define parameters in `agent_config.yaml`, `metadata_rules.yaml`, and `prompt_templates.yaml`.
2. **Core Connectivity:**

   - Implement and test the Milvus connector in `milvus_connector.py`.
   - Validate security filtering in `security_filter.py`.

3. **Agent & Worker Logic:**

   - Build out `researcher_agent.py` and `recursive_worker.py` with worker spawning and recursive query handling.
   - Integrate worker management in `worker_manager.py`.

4. **LLM & Summarization:**

   - Develop `llm_interface.py` for LLM calls.
   - Implement summarization logic in `summary_generator.py` and citation formatting in `citation_formatter.py`.

5. **Utilities & Helpers:**

   - Implement common helper functions, logging setup, and embedding generation utilities.

6. **Testing & Benchmarking:**

   - Write tests for each module in the `tests/` directory.
   - Benchmark recursion and worker performance with `benchmark_recursion.py`.

7. **Documentation & Maintenance:**
   - Finalize `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and inline docstrings.
   - Set up logging, error monitoring, and continuous integration testing.
