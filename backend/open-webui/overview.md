# Open-WebUI

This directory contains subdirectories for models to be ported to Open-WebUI. Each model has a file pipeline.py which is the combined pipeline of the model. This combined model is essentially all the files in the model directory put together. This can be used as a base for the model in Open-WebUI. The other files are created for easier development.
